 By default, the Garbage Collector of the JavaScriptCore JS engine detects whether
 JS objects are used by looking at the native stack of each thread, and mark any

 this can result in objects being incorrectly freed and cause undefined behaviors. This
 flag enforces that the JS objects used within the Valdi C++ runtime are protected,
 even if they are seemingly reachable from the stack. This comes at a performance cost
 when marshalling JS objects.
