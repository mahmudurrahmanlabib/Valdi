# test_svg passes but was not gated. Safe on Linux: it only deps :valdi_svg and
# //snap_drawing:test_utils, so it avoids the runtime link that keeps test_runtime macOS-only
# (see the block below). The full //valdi:test (incl. test_integration) runs on both platforms
# at the bottom of this script; the old "main thread dispatch" abort is gone (its trigger,
# canLockAllJSContexts, is DISABLED, so the suite runs green).

# The hot-reload smoke runs as its own parallel job on external GitHub Actions
# (the hotreload-smoke matrix leg). Gate it here too — but ONLY internally (skip
# on GitHub Actions to avoid duplicating that job) and only on Linux (it needs
# watchman, installed by setup_linux_env.sh) — so internal cool Linux catches
# reloader / compiler-monitor breakage before it mirrors to the public repo.
#
# Force the from-source reloader (use_local_compiler=true). Copybara flips this
# on for the public mirror, so external CI already builds it from source; the
# internal monorepo defaults it off and would otherwise run the GCS-prebuilt
# reloader binary. That prebuilt (pinned, older) binary hangs on startup in
# --usb mode here — it prints "Started listening for ADB devices" and never
# reaches the initial compile — so the smoke times out waiting for the reloader.
# Building from source matches the external path that passes.

# Raise the console stdout/stderr cap: //valdi:test is a single binary and its whole-suite output
